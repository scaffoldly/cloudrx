# Current Objective - CloudRx Development Session

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED & DOCUMENTED
Last updated: 2025-01-06

## Recent Completed Work

### Architecture Refactoring (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Successfully moved `storeAndVerifyThenEmit` method from CloudSubject to CloudProvider as new `persist` method
- ✅ Improved separation of concerns - persistence logic now at provider level
- ✅ CloudSubject.next() now uses provider.persist() with callback pattern
- ✅ All 11 tests passing (3 unit + 8 integration)
- ✅ Clean console output maintained with friendly test messages
- ✅ No linting errors, TypeScript compilation successful

### Package.json Updates (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Changed `test:all` script to use verbose mode by default
- ✅ Removed redundant `test:all:verbose` script
- ✅ Current script: `"test:all": "npm run test:verbose && npm run test:integration:verbose"`

### Documentation Updates (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with all recent architectural changes and patterns
- ✅ Added persist method documentation and store-then-verify-then-emit pattern details
- ✅ Documented ESLint and Jest configuration changes
- ✅ Added architecture evolution section with refactoring details
- ✅ Updated testing best practices with console.log and verbose output notes

## Project State

### Key Files Modified
- `src/providers/cloud-provider.ts` - Added `persist()` method with store-verify-emit pattern
- `src/subjects/cloud-subject.ts` - Simplified to use provider.persist() 
- `package.json` - Updated test scripts for verbose output by default
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation updates with all patterns and changes
- `.claude/current-objective.md` - Session state and roadmap tracking

### Architecture Improvements
- Better encapsulation of persistence logic at provider level
- Reusable persist method for future cloud-backed observables
- Maintained all existing functionality with cleaner design

### Test Status
- All tests passing with clean, friendly console output
- Integration tests show proper emoji indicators and progress messages
- No "scary" error messages - all warnings properly categorized

## Future Roadmap

### Provider Implementations
- **AWS S3 Provider** - File-based persistence for larger payloads
- **Azure Blob Storage Provider** - Microsoft cloud storage backend
- **Google Cloud Storage Provider** - GCP storage backend
- **Redis Provider** - In-memory caching layer for high-performance scenarios

### Advanced Features
- **CloudObservable** - Read-only observables that replay from cloud storage
- **Time-based Operators** - Custom RxJS operators for temporal cloud operations
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handling concurrent writes across distributed systems
- **Partitioning/Sharding** - Scale to handle high-volume streams
- **Compression** - Optimize storage costs for large payloads
- **Encryption** - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data streams

### Developer Experience
- **CLI Tools** - Command-line utilities for stream management
- **Monitoring Dashboard** - Real-time visibility into cloud stream health
- **Performance Metrics** - Latency, throughput, and error rate tracking
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and API references

### Enterprise Features
- **Multi-region Replication** - Cross-region data consistency
- **Backup/Restore** - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions and audit logging
- **Cost Optimization** - Storage lifecycle management

## Next Steps (if needed)
- No immediate tasks pending
- User approaching usage limit - session may need continuation
- All requested refactoring and improvements completed successfully

## Technical Context
- CloudRx: TypeScript library extending RxJS with cloud-backed subjects
- Store-then-verify-then-emit pattern for guaranteed persistence
- DynamoDB provider with eventual consistency handling
- Jest testing with console.log interception and clean output
